# Performance Optimization

## Model Selection Strategy

Subagents use only `opus` or `sonnet`, chosen by task difficulty (see [dev-workflow.md](../dev-workflow.md)):

**Sonnet** (well-scoped work):
- Implementation with a clear plan
- Routine code review
- Batched small tasks

**Opus** (deepest reasoning):
- Architecture and design decisions
- Complex, ambiguous, or cross-cutting tasks
- Research, analysis, and security-sensitive review

## Context Window Management

Avoid last 20% of context window for:
- Large-scale refactoring
- Feature implementation spanning multiple files
- Debugging complex interactions

Lower context sensitivity tasks:
- Single-file edits
- Independent utility creation
- Documentation updates
- Simple bug fixes

## Extended Thinking + Plan Mode

Extended thinking is enabled by default, reserving up to 31,999 tokens for internal reasoning.

Control extended thinking via:
- **Toggle**: Option+T (macOS) / Alt+T (Windows/Linux)
- **Config**: Set `alwaysThinkingEnabled` in `~/.claude/settings.json`
- **Budget cap**: `export MAX_THINKING_TOKENS=10000` (bash) or `$env:MAX_THINKING_TOKENS = "10000"` (PowerShell)
- **Verbose mode**: Ctrl+O to see thinking output

For complex tasks requiring deep reasoning:
1. Ensure extended thinking is enabled (on by default)
2. Enable **Plan Mode** for structured approach
3. Use multiple critique rounds for thorough analysis
4. Use split role sub-agents for diverse perspectives

## Build Troubleshooting

If build fails:
1. Use **build-error-resolver** agent
2. Analyze error messages
3. Fix incrementally
4. Verify after each fix
